## Getting Started

You can build and run the app without any configuration but you will have api limitations. You need to have an **Api Key** to avoid limitations.<br>
You can generate an **Api Key** from [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). Then you generated an api key, you have to specify it to `_apodApi` in `ApodService` in `lib/api/nasa_apod_service.dart` file.

### Enjoy the app!
